You are building a vault that requires three mathematical calculations to generate the three codes in a combination. Use the JavaScript console or the script block within an HTML page to create three variables. Each variable will be the result of each calculation (three in total). The combination of the lock is 10 - 40 - 39. You must use three different arithmetic operators that will generate each individual number, then display the combination on the HTML page, or in an alert popup.
